GitOps
- Use Declarative decoration: describe DBs, files
- Versioned and Immutable: use a version and be immutable - use some version system and store it
- Deployed automatically: After that it goes continue delivery in some location
- Continuously reconciled: Monitoring continually, some gitops agent can do some reconciliation to avoid some bad connections, some connections to remote servers
- Operated in a closed loop: This should trigger some kind of loop, avoid people connecting directly to prod, downtime
